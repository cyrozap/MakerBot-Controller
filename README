INSTRUCTIONS:
Clone the repository, build with Xcode, then install the app on your iOS device.

BACKGROUND:
I'm making this app to both teach me a little Objective-C and to give me (and hopefully others) a means of simply controlling a MakerBot from an iPhone.

EXPLANATIONS:
This app is not yet optimized for the iPad because:
	1. I don't yet own an iPad.
	2. I'm a novice programmer and adding an iPad version to the project would complicate things.

CONTRIBUTE:
If you want to contribute to the development of this app, feel free to fork the repository and make any improvements you want. If I deem your improvements worthy, I'll merge them back into the main branch. Yay, open source!

TO DO:
- Add GCode support.
- Add STL import & slicing support.
- Add STL viewing (on iPad).
- Make it beautiful.
